# k8s-training
A place to learn about kubernetes

# TODO
(Break the below into smaller tasks and turn into GH issues)
- Deploy a HA k8s cluster with EC2 instances using TF
- API which deploys above cluster
- Validation framework
- Create some scenarios (fix broken pod, upgrade cluster, renew ETCd certificate, manually replace broken node)
- Deploy EKS using TF (for the API to deploy) 
- Scenario for EKS (introduce OIDC, service mesh)
- Infra cleanup task (custodian?)
- Frontend to deploy/manage
